## Currently broken

This project is an attempt of mine on creating rust bindings for the [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) windows manager on Linux.
I aim to adjust the behavior of workspaces in hyprland to instead resemble the way workspaces are handled in [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/), another windows manager on Linux.

An existing project, which was an inspiration for this one, is available at https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces.

This project is not actively being developed, and I aim to return to it in a month or so.
